I coded pdf recognition. Sometimes it works fine,but there are problems:

- White text on black background is nor recognized
- A lot of spaces are generated in the file with medical test

If needed we return to it back later.
Now the goal is to try making classifications.
SO we will initialize some model, and then classify it.
Then we will find some texts.
